<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
    I am a 20 year old who enjoys reading korean manwha and watching anime.<br/>
    I also like to play field hockey once a while when I get the chance.<br/>
    I watch movies too. I prefer genres like romcoms and general comedic movies.<br/>
    I do a bit of writing my self and I even published 2 children books on the e-kindle store<br/>on amazon.<br/>
    I like singing a lot and I'm pretty good at it too. I listen to songs on my phone when I'm bored.
